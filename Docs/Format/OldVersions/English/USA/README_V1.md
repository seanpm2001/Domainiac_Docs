# Domainiac Docs

## Format

This document is a vital piece of documentation for Domainiac. It goes over the format of entries used in the project. For the file structure that the project uses, see [`File-Structure`](/Docs/File-Structure/)

### Top

The top of the document contains the title, which is `# .domain` below this is the associated icon for this TLD. There is also a link to a URLL file database that contains the websites that use this domain. In the lead section, information about its usage, and its alternatives are listed.

For more information on the URLL database, see [`Domain listing`](/Docs/Domain-listing/)

### Subsections

There are 4 main subsections:

- First level domains
- Second level domains
- Subdomains
- Restrictions

These sometimes have a `usage` sub-subsection.

### Dotfile

The first README located at `/dot/` contains jump links to each domain associated with this directory. The ccTLD page for India will be used as an example here:
